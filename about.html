                <p class="card-text">The idea for Dayily Planner® was born in 2018. It grew from chaos: an overflowing email inbox, a hand-scribbled to-do list, a pile of meeting notes and a daunting schedule. Whether you’re a working professional, full-time mom, or a diligent student, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and pulled in a million directions. Created by Whitney English, Day Designer is a simple and easy system created to help you find balance, focus and productivity. </p> <br><br> 

                <p class="card-text"> This planner isn’t magic, and it can’t live your life for you. But it can, through a simple, guided framework, help you figure out a focus for intentional living. It can be a trusted tool for setting goals, creating a plan and taking action each and every day. We're so grateful to the wonderful planner community that has developed over the last few years. Thank you for sharing your stories. We love hearing how the Day Designer has helped you live an intentional, meaningful and well-designed life! </p> <br><br>

                <p class="card-text"> "I’m SO in love with this planner. It really makes you think about your goals for the day, month and year and has forced me to get control of my daily schedule. I feel so less stressed! Thank you so much!" "This is seriously the BEST day planner I’ve ever seen. Even unwrapping it from the package made me smile and I can’t wait to fill it in! I highly recommend this to any right-brained business owner who is looking for a way to manage goal setting, to-do’s, scheduling + other goodies all in one place." </p>
                <br><br> 

                <p class="card-text">"My first year having a Day Designer planner and I couldn't be more obsessed! It's such a lifesaver!" <br><br> "Love mine – with this and a couple of your printables, planner peace has finally arrived."

                    <br><br> “This multi-purpose planner does it all. Through specialized pages that help you plan in various increments of time, you’ll be able to set and track your goals with ease. Not to mention, the beautifully designed hard cover!” – InStyle</p>
